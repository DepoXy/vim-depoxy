" USAGE: This plugin wires the following bindings:
"
"   \F       ‚Äî Open FZF in Vim on paths under user home
"
"   \f       ‚Äî Open FZF in Vim on paths in current Git project
"
"   :F <term> ‚Äî Open FZF in Vim on ~/.projlns/depoxy-deeplinks
"               files with matching <term> in their contents
"
"   :D <term> ‚Äî Open FZF in Vim on ~/.kit/docs/source
"               files with matching <term> in their contents
"
"   :FF <term> ‚Äî Open FZF in Vim on current Git project's
"                files with matching <term> in their contents
"
" CXREF: See more FZF ref. in the complementary shell file:
"
"   ~/.depoxy/ambers/core/fzf-setup.sh

" ***

" Configure fzf.
"
" USYNC: The FZF_DEFAULT_COMMAND string below was copied from a DepoXy shell:
"
"   echo "${FZF_DEFAULT_COMMAND}"
"
" CXREF: ~/.depoxy/ambers/core/fzf-setup.sh
"
" - ALTLY: We could actually omit the FZF_DEFAULT_COMMAND setting if you
"   start Vim from a DepoXy terminal. But embedding it ensures that FZF
"   still works if you start Vim from a Launcher, or Spotlight, etc.
"
" SAVVY: `fzf` must be found on PATH.
"
" - DepoXy installs a symlink at ~/.local/bin/fzf
"
" HSTRY: This previously used an `fd` command [2024-11-14], e.g.:
"
"   function! s:SetFzfEnvirons()
"     if !executable("fd")
"       return
"     endif
"     let $FZF_DEFAULT_COMMAND="fd --type f --hidden --follow --exclude .git"
"     let $FZF_CTRL_T_COMMAND=$FZF_DEFAULT_COMMAND
"   endfunction
"
" - But author now prefers `rg`, for whatever reason.
"   - See more comments in ~/.depoxy/ambers/core/fzf-setup.sh
"
" ALTLY: Rather than being exclusive, we could be inclusive, e.g.,:
"
"   \ -g "*.{js,json,php,md,styl,jade,html,config,py,cpp,c,go,hs,rb,conf}"
"
" - But author more likely knows which files they don't care about, and
"   less likely about which files they do/might care about. (E.g., if
"   you start working with a new language, e.g., Rust, I'd probably
"   forget to come here to add the ".rs" extension (or I'd be annoyed
"   that I had to).)

function! s:SetFzfEnvirons()
  if !executable("rg")
    return
  endif

  " USYNC: See comment above: Copy this string from your shell.
  " - Also update the rg_command, below.

  let $FZF_DEFAULT_COMMAND="rg --files --hidden --follow --no-ignore-vcs --no-ignore-parent -g '!**/{.git,.tox,node_modules,.crypt}/**' -g '!**/{*.swp,.bash_history,*.bin,*.gif,*.gpg,*.jpg,*.Jpg,*.JPG,*.nib,*.odg,*.odt,*.pdf,*.Pdf,*.PDF,*.png,*.pyc,*.svg,.viminfo,*.xpm,*.zip}'"

  " MAYBE/2020-02-13: Not sure I want --no-ignore.
  " - 2021-01-29: Only recently started (I'm trying) to use FZF more,
  "               and I haven't noticed --no-ignore including files I
  "               don't want to see included... but I'll keep a looko.
  " MAYBE/2020-02-13: Is there reason to prefer `rg` over `fd`?
  " - Note that FZF (fzf#vim#grep) uses `rg` to show only files that
  "   match a term being searched. It works as an alternative to `fd`,
  "   helping to narrow your search, and to show you a little context
  "   for each file, displaying the matched line after the file name.

  " let g:rg_command = '
  "   \ rg --column --line-number --no-heading --fixed-strings --ignore-case --no-ignore --hidden --follow --color "always"
  "   \ -g "*.{js,json,php,md,styl,jade,html,config,py,cpp,c,go,hs,rb,conf}"
  "   \ -g "!{.git,node_modules,vendor}/*" '

  " USYNC: Copy the globs from $FZF_DEFAULT_COMMAND, above.
  let g:rg_command = '
    \ rg --hidden --follow --no-ignore-vcs --no-ignore-parent
      \ --column --line-number --no-heading --fixed-strings --ignore-case  --color "always"
      \ -g "!**/{.git,.tox,node_modules,.crypt}/**"
      \ -g "!**/{*.swp,.bash_history,*.bin,*.gif,*.gpg,*.jpg,*.Jpg,*.JPG,*.nib,*.odg,*.odt,*.pdf,*.Pdf,*.PDF,*.png,*.pyc,*.svg,.viminfo,*.xpm,*.zip}"
    \ '

  " The `:F {term}` command is pretty nifty, it'll search in files for
  " the term, and then give you a fuzzy finder prompt to narrow down
  " the matches *by filename* to find the exact file you want.
  " (2021-01-29: Well, it seems nifty -- I respect innovative commands,
  "  no matter how esoteric -- but it remains to be seen how useful I'll
  "  find this feature personally. Especially because this feature is not
  "  so unique; as there are many other ways to search for a file to open,
  "  and I tend to prefer using dubs_greps_steady (`\g`) and perusing
  "  results in the quickfix. Whether using the quickfix or FZF is quicker,
  "  well, that might be what drives me to use one or the other.)
  " ONICE/2024-11-14: One advantage is that the FZF window loads
  " aynchronously, unlike Quickfix which doesn't show any results
  " until all results are in.

  " MAYBE/2024-11-14: Should this command not impose a search directory?
  " - This command used to search the current directory, e.g.,
  "     command! -bang -nargs=* F call fzf#vim#grep(g:rg_command .. shellescape(<q-args>), 1, <bang>0)
  "   - SAVVY: But note:
  "     - The command reports 'Command failed' if no matches found.
  "       - So you'd often want to :cd first.
  "       - Also 'Command failed' makes it sound like the `rg` command
  "         is malformed, as opposed to their just being no matches.
  "     - Searching all files under home takes a while, and it includes
  "       a lot of noise.
  " - So for now we'll search the DepoXy ~/.projlns directory, which is
  "   meant to be inclusive of all files the user would ever care about.
  "   - In this way, the search functionality matches how the author
  "     normally searches their files. And by providing a closer
  "     resemblence to the `\g` dubs-grep-steady command, it'll
  "     encourage the author to try using FZF instead of grep-steady,
  "     and it'll better inform me which one I like better.
  "   - Though be aware: Unlike grep-steady, you cannot easily change
  "     the search directory, and currently ~/.projlns *excludes* the
  "     author's notes files (which is a separate path in dubs_projects.vim
  "     that I choose when I want to search docs... so maybe I just need a
  "     second command wired to the docs path...).

  " FIXEM/2024-11-15: Note you cannot use quotes or word boundary esacpes.
  " - E.g., none of these work:
  "     :F " FF "
  "     :F ' FF '
  "     :F \bGlcd\b
  "     :F \<Glcd\>
  "     :F \\bGlcd\\b
  "     :F \\<Glcd\\>
  " - This is a LOPRI request because grep-steady supports those searches.
