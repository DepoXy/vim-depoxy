" 2020-04-21: Brilliant! I've been tripping on "q:" accidentally for years!
" - I've never use the command-line window, except accidentally,
"   and you can still see it -- and search it -- with "q/" or "q?".
" - So now I can fastly type ":q" and not worry if I get me keys crossed.
" REFER:

" Remap q:, because I often type :q too fast and get the characters backwards.
" - I don't use the command window often, but sometimes I want to copy from it.
" REFER: You can also use `:<Ctrl-F>` to open command window (Vim built-in).
noremap q: <Nop>
noremap q:: :<C-F>

" Unmapping Q also suggested, but I don't have a problem with *this* Q.
